> **🧠 Fun Fact:**  
> The term **“bug”** in computer science became widely used after a real **moth** was found in the **Mark II computer** at Harvard in **1947**. Engineers "debugged" the system—literally!

### 🔍 A Little History:

On September 9, 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator documented the cause of a malfunction: a moth trapped in a relay. They removed it and taped it to the logbook with the note **"First actual case of bug being found."**

Even though the term "bug" had been used before to describe mechanical glitches (even by Edison), this incident made it iconic in computing history.

## 🤔 Did You Know?

- The logbook with the moth is now preserved in the **Smithsonian National Museum of American History**.
- Grace Hopper, a computing pioneer, was part of the team and helped popularize the story (though she didn't discover the bug herself).
